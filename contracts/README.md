 - Each "answer" is a "round"
 - The owner is the only person that can start a new round
 - The round needs to have a minimum duration
 - There needs to be a "winner" to start the next round
 - The contract needs to be an NFT contract
    - ERC-1155{token id 0 for winners,token id 1 for runners up}
    - Mint ID 0 if the user is the firt person to guess correctly in the round
    - Mint ID 1 if they got it correct but they are not the first in that round
- To check if the user's guess is correct , we will call the verifier smart contract
